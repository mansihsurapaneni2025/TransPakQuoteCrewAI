Test Plan: TransPak AI Quoter SystemThis document outlines the test cases required to validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of the TransPak AI Quoter system. The plan is divided into five key areas, covering all aspects of the application stack.1. Frontend (FE) - The User InterfaceThis section focuses on the user-facing web interface. The primary goal is to ensure it is intuitive, responsive, and error-free.Test Case IDFeature / ComponentTest DescriptionExpected ResultTest TypeFE-001Quote Request FormSubmit a quote request with all fields filled with valid data.Form submits successfully without errors. A confirmation message is displayed, and the backend process is initiated.FunctionalFE-002Form ValidationAttempt to submit the form with missing required fields (e.g., no dimensions).An inline error message appears next to the empty field. The form does not submit.UI/UXFE-003Form ValidationAttempt to submit the form with invalid data (e.g., text in the "Weight" field).An inline error message appears, specifying the data format error. The form does not submit.UI/UXFE-004Quote Status DisplayAfter submitting a quote, check the dashboard or quote history page.The new quote appears with a status of "In Progress" or "Processing".FunctionalFE-005Final Quote DisplayView a completed quote.The final quote is displayed in a clear, professional format, containing all sections (Crating, Logistics, Total Cost).UI/UXFE-006Responsive DesignAccess the website on different screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).The layout adjusts correctly to each screen size without broken elements or horizontal scrolling.UI/UX2. Backend (BE) - The AI Agent CrewThis is the core of the system. Tests focus on each agent's individual logic and their ability to collaborate effectively within the Crew.Test Case IDFeature / ComponentTest DescriptionExpected ResultTest TypeBE-001SalesBriefingAgentProvide a simple set of shipment details to the agent.The agent correctly parses and structures the details into a "Shipment Brief" document.UnitBE-002CratingDesignAgentProvide a Shipment Brief with standard dimensions and low fragility.The agent designs a simple, low-cost crating solution.UnitBE-003CratingDesignAgentProvide a Shipment Brief with large dimensions and "Highly Fragile" notes.The agent designs a more complex, reinforced crate with higher material costs.FunctionalBE-004LogisticsPlannerAgentProvide a Shipment Brief with a domestic, common shipping route.The agent calculates a standard freight cost and timeline.UnitBE-005LogisticsPlannerAgentProvide a Shipment Brief with an international destination requiring customs.The agent's plan includes notes on customs and a higher freight cost.FunctionalBE-006QuoteConsolidatorAgentProvide mock cost data from Crating and Logistics agents.The agent correctly sums the costs, applies the predefined profit margin, and generates a final total.UnitBE-007Full Crew Workflow(End-to-End Test) Initiate a quote for a standard domestic shipment.The crew runs sequentially, passing context from one agent to the next, and produces a complete, accurate final quote document.IntegrationBE-008Error HandlingKick off the crew with invalid input (e.g., nonsensical dimensions).The process gracefully fails and logs an error, rather than crashing. The user is notified of the failure.Exception3. Database (DB) - Data PersistenceThese tests ensure that data is stored, retrieved, and managed correctly.Test Case IDFeature / ComponentTest DescriptionExpected ResultTest TypeDB-001Quote CreationAfter a quote is successfully generated by the crew, query the database.A new record exists in the quotes table with the correct shipment details, costs, and a "Completed" status.Data IntegrityDB-002Quote HistoryQuery the database for all quotes associated with a specific user or customer ID.The query returns all, and only, the quotes belonging to that user.Data IntegrityDB-003Data SchemaAttempt to insert data with a mismatched data type (e.g., string for a cost field).The database rejects the transaction, ensuring data type integrity.Data Integrity4. 3rd Party Integrations - API ConnectionsThis section focuses on the communication with external services, which is vital for the AI's "thinking" process.Test Case IDFeature / ComponentTest DescriptionExpected ResultTest TypeAPI-001OpenAI APIMake a call to the LLM with a valid API key and a simple prompt.A successful (200 OK) response is received from the OpenAI API.ConnectivityAPI-002OpenAI API (Auth)Make a call to the LLM with an invalid or expired API key.An authentication error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) is received. The system handles this gracefully.ExceptionAPI-003OpenAI API (Timeout)Simulate a delayed response from the API that exceeds the system's timeout limit.The system cancels the request and logs a timeout error, rather than hanging indefinitely.Resilience5. Cloud & Deployment - InfrastructureThese are high-level checks to ensure the deployed application is stable and observable.Test Case IDFeature / ComponentTest DescriptionExpected ResultTest TypeCL-001DeploymentDeploy a new version of the application.The application deploys successfully and becomes available at its public URL without downtime (if using blue-green deployment).Smoke TestCL-002LoggingRun a full crew workflow and then check the application logs (e.g., in Replit console or a cloud logging service).The logs show the start and end of the process, which agent is running, and any errors encountered.ObservabilityCL-003Environment VariablesCheck that the application is correctly loading secrets (API Keys, DB credentials).The application connects to all services successfully. There are no logs indicating missing secrets.Configuration
