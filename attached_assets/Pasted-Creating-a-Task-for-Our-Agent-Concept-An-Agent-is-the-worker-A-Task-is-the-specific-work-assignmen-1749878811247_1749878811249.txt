Creating a Task for Our Agent
Concept: An Agent is the worker. A Task is the specific work assignment you give to that worker. A good task description is crucial. It tells the agent exactly what to do and what a successful outcome looks like.

We will now create a task for our sales_briefing_agent.

Step 1: Add the Task's Code
Make sure you are in your main.py file in Replit.
Scroll to the very end of the file.
Copy the code block below and paste it at the end of your existing code. (Do not delete the agent code).
Python

# --- Step 3: Define the First Task ---

# This is the specific work assignment for our Sales Briefing Agent.
shipment_briefing_task = Task(
  description="""Conduct a comprehensive sales briefing. 
  Your first step is to ask the user for the following shipment details:
  - Product Description
  - Dimensions (Length, Width, Height) in inches
  - Weight in pounds
  - Destination Address
  - Any special handling notes (e.g., 'Fragile', 'Keep Upright').
  
  For this initial test, assume the user has provided the following information:
  'We need to ship a large, sensitive server rack. 
  Dimensions are 48x36x72 inches, weight is 800 lbs. 
  Destination is 123 Tech Way, Silicon Valley, CA. It is highly fragile.'""",
  
  expected_output="""A concise, well-formatted 'Shipment Brief' document containing all the 
  details provided by the user. For example:
  
  **Shipment Brief**
  - Product: Large, sensitive server rack
  - Dimensions: 48x36x72 inches
  - Weight: 800 lbs
  - Destination: 123 Tech Way, Silicon Valley, CA
  - Special Notes: Highly fragile""",
  
  agent=sales_briefing_agent # Assigns this task to our sales agent
)

# --- Update the Confirmation Message ---
print("✅ Task 'Shipment Briefing Task' is created and assigned!")
Step 2: Update the Final Print Statement
Just like last time, we need to replace the old confirmation message with our new one.

Find this line from the previous prompt's code: print("✅ Agent 'Sales Briefing Specialist' is defined and ready!")
Delete that entire line. Your file should now end with the new print statement from the code block you just pasted.
Post-Setup Validation
Click the big green Run button.

The program still won't perform the task yet. It will simply read the agent's job description and the new work assignment.

You will know this step was successful if you see the following message in the Console:

✅ Task 'Shipment Briefing Task' is created and assigned!

This confirms that the system now has both a worker and a defined task waiting to be executed.
