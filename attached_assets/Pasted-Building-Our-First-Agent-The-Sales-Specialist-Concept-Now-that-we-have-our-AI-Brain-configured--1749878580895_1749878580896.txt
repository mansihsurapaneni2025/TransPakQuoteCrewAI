Building Our First Agent (The Sales Specialist)
Concept: Now that we have our "AI Brain" configured, we can hire our first employee. In crewai, an Agent is like a job description for an AI worker. We define its role, its ultimate goal, and its backstory to give it a specific personality and area of expertise. We then give it access to the AI Brain (llm) so it can think.

We will now define our first agent from the blueprint: the SalesBriefingAgent. We'll build its job description to include the responsibility of checking the database.

A Note on the Database: For now, we will tell the agent that it can access the database as part of its goal. The actual technical connection to the database requires a "Tool," which is a more advanced step we can explore after this initial 5-prompt sprint. This prompt focuses on creating the agent's identity.

Step 1: Add the Agent's Code
Make sure you are in your main.py file in Replit.
Scroll to the very end of the file.
Copy the code block below and paste it at the end of your existing code. Do not delete the previous code.
Python

# --- Step 2: Define The First Agent (The Sales Specialist) ---

# This is the "job description" for our first AI agent.
sales_briefing_agent = Agent(
  role='Sales Briefing Specialist',
  goal="""Gather all necessary shipment details from the user and conduct 
  an initial customer lookup in the company database. Your goal is to create a 
  comprehensive 'Shipment Brief' that will be used by the other agents.""",
  backstory="""You are an expert in customer communication and requirements gathering. 
  With years of experience in the logistics industry, you know exactly what questions 
  to ask to capture all critical details about a shipment. You are also proficient 
  in querying the internal database to check for existing customer profiles and history.""",
  llm=llm,  # The agent uses the OpenAI brain we configured
  verbose=True,  # We want to see the agent's thinking process
  allow_delegation=False # This agent does not delegate tasks to others
)

# --- Update the Confirmation Message ---
# We change the print statement to reflect our new progress.
print("✅ Agent 'Sales Briefing Specialist' is defined and ready!")

Step 2: Update the Final Print Statement
In the code you just pasted, the final line is a new print() statement. You must now delete the old print statement from the previous step.

Find this line from the previous prompt's code: print("✅ Tech Stack and OpenAI Brain are successfully configured!")
Delete that entire line. Your file should now end with the new print statement.
Post-Setup Validation
Click the big green Run button again.

Because we haven't given our agent a task yet, the program will simply define the agent and print our new confirmation message.

You will know this step was successful if you see the following message in the Console:

✅ Agent 'Sales Briefing Specialist' is defined and ready!

This confirms that the "job description" for our first agent has been loaded and understood by the system.
